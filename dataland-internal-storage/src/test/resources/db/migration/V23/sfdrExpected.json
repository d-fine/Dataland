A special focus is on the \"Adopt a tree\" project, where over 400 trees have been planted in the community. In addition, the removal of invasive species such as Scaveola Taccada (commonly known as \"Sea Lettuce\") is promoted in Princess Cays and Half Moon Cay to protect the local flora.\n\nThese measures are part of a broader approach to support the environment and combat deforestation by preserving and restoring natural habitats.",
