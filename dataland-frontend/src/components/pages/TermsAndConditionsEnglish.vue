    <h1>General terms and conditions for participation in Dataland</h1>
    <h1>(„AGB-Dataland“)</h1>
    <div>
      <h2>Preliminary remark</h2>
      <p>
        Dataland GmbH (hereinafter: "Dataland") operates a platform (hereinafter: "Dataland Platform") to compile
        company-related data, in particular in the areas of environment ("Environmental"), social affairs ("Social") and
        corporate governance ("Governance"), and to make it available to its users (hereinafter: "Data Users")
        (hereinafter: "Company Data").
      </p>
      <p>
        The (natural and legal) persons registered on the Dataland platform (hereinafter: "Dataland participants") can
        transfer Company Data to Dataland as so-called Data Collectors. Companies can do the same with the Company Data
        that concerns them (so-called "Data Owners"). The Company Data on the Dataland platform can be downloaded and
        used by Data Users.
      </p>
      <p>
        The aim of Dataland is to create a knowledge platform that is open to everyone and to make Company Data
        available to all Data Users. Dataland checks the entered Company Data with automated tests. In addition, random
        checks are carried out on individual data. Otherwise, the content of the Company Data transmitted by the Data
        Collectors or Data Owners to the Dataland platform and made available there is not checked.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following terms and conditions govern the general registration as a Dataland Participant as well as the
        registration and participation in Dataland as a Data User, Data Collector and Data Owner.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Registration on the Dataland platform</h2>
      <p>In order to participate in Dataland, it is first necessary to register as a Dataland Participant.</p>
      <p>
        In addition to registration as a Dataland Participant (but not without it), registrations as a Data Collector,
        Data Owner and Data User may be made.
      </p>
      <p>The prerequisite for registration of the (natural or legal) person is their full legal capacity.</p>
      <p>
        A (natural or legal) person may only register as one Dataland Participant and, based on this registration, may
        only register as one Data Collector, Data Owner and/or Data User.
      </p>
      <p>
        Registration with Dataland initially takes place in such a way that the mandatory fields marked with an "*" are
        filled in completely and truthfully. Additional information (marked as optional) can also be provided.
      </p>
      <p>
        The registrant can give him-/herself a login name and password during the registration process. The password
        must be kept secret and may not be made available to third parties. If a Dataland Participant becomes aware that
        third parties have learned its password or have gained unauthorised access to Dataland under its login name,
        Dataland must be informed of this immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the mandatory fields have been completed and the corresponding application for registration has been sent
        by clicking on the "Request registration" field, Dataland will review the application for registration. After
        review and a positive decision on the application for registration, the applicant will be confirmed as a
        Dataland Participant or, in the case of corresponding applications, as a Data Collector, Data Owner or Data
        User.
      </p>
      <p>Dataland is under no obligation to accept and confirm a registration.</p>
      <p>Dataland is under no obligation to accept and confirm a registration.</p>
      <p>
        Irrespective of other cancellation rights, Dataland is entitled to cancel or revoke participation in Dataland
        and all registrations with immediate effect if the Dataland Participant has provided false information during
        registration, has registered twice or has breached any contractual obligations incumbent upon it.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Conditions applicable to Dataland Participants:</h2>
      <div>
        <h3>The rights of use of the Dataland Participant</h3>
        <p>
          Upon registration, the Dataland Participant receives the right to access the Dataland Platform. This includes,
          in particular, the right to view the Company Data on the website (read-only right). The Company Data may not
          be copied or downloaded.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a Dataland Participant, it has the option of registering as a Data User, Data Owner or Data Collector in
          accordance with the provisions of § 1.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>The Dataland Participant's remuneration obligations</h3>
        <p>The Dataland Participant's remuneration obligations</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Term of registration as a Dataland Participant</h3>
        <p>Registration as a Dataland Participant is for an indefinite term.</p>
        <p>The registration can be cancelled by either party with one month's notice to the end of a calendar month.</p>
        <p>The right to terminate for good cause remains unaffected in all cases.</p>
        <p>
          At the end of the registration as a Dataland Participant, all further registrations of the respective Dataland
          Participant shall also end automatically.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>The following additional conditions apply to Data Users:</h2>
      <div>
        <h3>The rights of use of the Data User</h3>
        <p>
          The Data User may use the Company Data obtained from Dataland for its business or private purposes in
          accordance with the following provisions. The Data User therefore receives a non-exclusive, simple,
          non-transferable, non-sublicensable right to use the Company Data, limited in time to the duration of the
          registration as a Data User.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reproduction, distribution or display to the public of the database consisting of the Company Data as a
          whole or of a substantial part of the database in terms of type and scope is not permitted. The repeated and
          systematic reproduction, distribution or public display of parts of the database that are insignificant in
          terms of type and scope shall be deemed equivalent to the reproduction, distribution or public communication
          of a part of the database that is significant in terms of type and scope, provided that these actions run
          counter to a normal evaluation of the database or unreasonably impair the legitimate interests of Dataland. In
          all other respects, §§ 87a ff UrhG shall apply.
        </p>
        <p>
          The search for Company Data and on the Dataland Platform may only be carried out using the access methods
          provided by Dataland (e.g. search functions, APIs). Bypassing this search function, e.g. through automated
          queries of the database and in general when using the Dataland Platform, is not permitted.
        </p>
        <p>
          When using the Company Data, the Data User must take into account the fact that the Company Data transmitted
          by the Data Collectors is provided and published as it is transmitted to Dataland. The Company Data is checked
          by Dataland prior to its initial provision and subsequently in terms of content only using automated tests. In
          addition, spot checks are carried out on individual data. Otherwise, the Company Data is not checked, verified
          or monitored with regard to its up-to-dateness and only errors that become positively known are corrected
          within the scope of what is possible and economically justifiable. For this reason, no guarantee can be given
          that the Company Data is correct, up to date and complete at a given time. Therefore, before making decisions
          of economic relevance, including investment decisions, on the basis of the Company Data made available on the
          Dataland platform, the Data User is obliged to check the accuracy and completeness of the content as well as
          verify that it is up to date. The Company Data and the information obtained from Dataland may only be used as
          a basis for investment decisions if this obligation is met.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Data User has no right to access the Dataland Platform at certain times and to access Company Data at
          certain times. In particular, Dataland shall not be obliged to notify the Data User of any periods of
          unavailability of the Platform Dataland or to guarantee unlimited and uninterrupted availability of the
          Platform Dataland in any other way.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Data User has no claim to the availability of certain Company Data on the Platform-Dataland. This also
          applies in particular to Company Data that was previously available there.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>The Data User's remuneration obligations</h3>
        <p>
          For private individuals, NGOs and non-profit research or teaching organisations (collectively also referred to
          as "Private Use" in these GTC-Dataland ), the use of Dataland is free of charge.
        </p>
        <p>
          A monthly flat rate is payable for use by all other Data Users, which is based on Dataland's current price
          scale (see <a href="/pricing">Link</a>).
        </p>
        <p>All fees are exclusive of the applicable value added tax.</p>
        <p>All fees are exclusive of the applicable value added tax.</p>
        <p>
          The Data User may fulfil his payment obligations not only by bank transfer but also by any of the payment
          methods indicated as payment methods on the Platform-Dataland.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Term of registration as a Data User</h3>
        <p>
          During the registration process, the Data User may choose to register as a Data User for a specific term or
          for an indefinite term.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the case of an indefinite term, either party may terminate the registration with one month's notice to the
          end of a calendar month. In the case of a fixed term, cancellation is not possible until the end of the term.
        </p>
        <p>
          Insofar as the registration as a Dataland Participant is cancelled before the expiry of an agreed specific
          term, the registration as a Data User shall also end as a result. If the registration as a Dataland subscriber
          is cancelled due to a termination by Dataland that was not pronounced for good cause, Dataland shall be
          obliged to reimburse the Data User pro rata remuneration for the period that had not yet expired at the time
          of the termination of the registration as a Data User.
        </p>
        <p>The right to terminate the contract for good cause remains unaffected in all cases.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Liability of Dataland towards Data Users</h3>
        <p>Liability of Dataland towards Data Users</p>
        <p>
          Dataland shall be liable for damages caused by slight negligence if the act of infringement attributable to
          Dataland constitutes a breach of cardinal obligations, whereby cardinal obligations are the essential
          obligations which form the basis of the use of the Platform-Dataland and the Company Data, which were decisive
          for the use of the Platform-Dataland and the Company Data and on the fulfilment of which the Data User may
          rely.
        </p>
        <p>
          If Dataland has breached cardinal obligations only through slight negligence, Dataland's liability shall be
          limited to foreseeable damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          If Dataland has breached cardinal obligations only through slight negligence, Dataland's liability shall be
          limited to foreseeable damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          In any event, i.e. notwithstanding any other provisions in these GTC-Dataland shall be liable without
          limitation for damage caused intentionally or by gross negligence as well as for damage resulting from injury
          to life, body or health by Dataland, its legal representatives or vicarious agents.
        </p>
        <p>
          In any event, i.e. notwithstanding any other provisions in these GTC-Dataland shall be liable without
          limitation for damage caused intentionally or by gross negligence as well as for damage resulting from injury
          to life, body or health by Dataland, its legal representatives or vicarious agents.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>The following additional conditions apply to Data Collectors:</h2>
      <div>
        <h3>Transfer of data to Dataland by the Data Collector</h3>
        <p>
          The Data Collector collates Company Data about a data object. It inserts the Company Data in relation to a
          data object into the data matrix that Dataland holds on the Dataland platform for this purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Company Data is provided by the Data Collector in relation to individual company topics or questions. Such
          a single unit is referred to as a data point. Several data points form a data set.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Data Collector can transfer Company Data to Dataland for a data object for which there was previously no
          Company Data. He can also supplement existing data records for a data object with missing data or update them
          with more recent Company Data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dataland shall have the right to review the Company Data entered by the Data Collector in accordance with
          Dataland's own requirements and at Dataland's sole discretion. Based on this review, Dataland shall decide
          whether the Company Data provided by the Data Collector shall be authorised as Company Data of the Dataland
          Platform for access by Data Users.
        </p>
        <p>
          Company Data authorised in this way shall be made available to Data Users on the Platform Data Land. As long
          as they are available to Data Users on the Platform Data Land, the Company Data shall serve as the basis for
          calculating the Data Collector's claim to remuneration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dataland shall inform the Data Collector if Company Data is not authorised. Dataland is not obliged to state
          the reasons for the refused authorisation. There is no entitlement to remuneration for Company Data that is
          not authorised or subsequently removed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even after the Company Data has been admitted to the Dataland Platform, Dataland shall have the right at any
          time and without restriction to review the Company Data in accordance with its own requirements and at
          Dataland's sole discretion and to decide on its retention on the Dataland Platform. In this respect, Dataland
          may freely decide at any time whether this Company Data provided by the Data Collector is to remain on the
          Dataland Platform as Company Data for access by Data Users or whether access to it is to be blocked. In the
          event of a blocking or removal of the Company Data, § 4.1.6 shall apply accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Data Collector has no right to access the Platform Dataland at certain times and to transmit Company Data
          from the Platform Dataland at certain times. In particular, Dataland shall not be obliged to notify the Data
          Collector of any periods of unavailability of the Platform Dataland or to otherwise guarantee unlimited and
          uninterrupted availability of the Platform Dataland.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Data Collector is aware that Dataland is entitled to make the Company Data available to the Data Users and
          Data Owners free of charge during the ramp-up phase of Dataland until spring 2024 and that this has a direct
          effect on the Data Collector's entitlement to remuneration pursuant to section 4.4.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Granting of rights of use to Dataland by the Data Collector</h3>
        <p>
          By submitting the Company Data on the Dataland Platform, the Data Collector transfers to Dataland a right of
          use in such a way that Dataland receives an irrevocable, spatially and content-wise unlimited, perpetual,
          transferable and sub-licensable right of use to all data as well as to the entirety of the data, even if these
          should form a database of § 87a of the Copyright Act. This includes in particular the non-withdrawable and
          non-revocable right to use this Company Data in any conceivable manner, in particular also in the context of
          any business activity, and to make it available or transfer it to third parties, so that these third parties
          also have corresponding rights. Likewise, Dataland has the unrestricted right to modify and/or process
          individual Company Data, the data in its entirety as well as any databases as a whole.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the event that the provisions in this contract are not sufficient to transfer the corresponding rights to
          Dataland to this extent, the Data Collector is obliged to bring about and effect such a granting of rights
          through corresponding separate legal declarations and actual acts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Data Collector guarantees to transfer only such Company Data to Dataland that are free of third party
          rights and for which neither contractual nor legal requirements prevent an actual transfer pursuant to § 4.1
          or the legally effective transfer of rights pursuant to this § 4.2.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Duties of the Data Collector</h3>
        <p>
          The Data Collector is obliged to transmit only such Company Data to Dataland of which the Data Collector is
          convinced, to the best of its knowledge and belief and applying the care required in business transactions,
          that this Company Data corresponds to actual circumstances and facts. In particular, the Company Data must not
          make a statement that distorts the meaning by omitting circumstances or facts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Data Collector is obliged to transfer to Dataland only such Company Data that Dataland can make available
          to the Data Users for the use described therein on the Dataland Platform without restriction and in particular
          without obtaining any consent or authorisation to that effect or without having to rely on statutory
          permissions in accordance with § 3.1, also with regard to the data protection laws and legal requirements.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>The Data Collector's claims to remuneration</h3>
        <p>
          The starting point for the Data Collector's remuneration is the Company Data that the Data Collector has made
          available to Dataland in relation to the individual company topics and that Dataland has consequently included
          in the Dataland Platform and that is available to the Data Users. The actual retrieval of the corresponding
          information by Data Users is not relevant with regard to the remuneration of the Data Collector.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on this principle, the remuneration of the Data Collector for the respective calendar year just ended is
          calculated as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            After the end of each calendar year, Dataland shall determine a share of the (net) revenue generated in
            accordance with § 3.2 (not taking into account the remuneration paid by means of Dataland Tokens), which
            shall be available as a total amount to remunerate the Data Collectors, whereby this share must be at least
            <a href="/pricing">Link</a> of the revenue generated.
          </li>
          <li>
            Furthermore, Dataland determines the distribution amount available for the respective day based on the
            revenue actually generated for each calendar day of this past calendar year ("Claim Days").
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally, Dataland determines how many data points according to § 4.1.2 existed in total on each individual
            day and how many data points are to be allocated to each individual Data Collector. In the case of data
            points for which there are versions of differing timeliness, only the most recent version of the data point
            is taken into account. The Data Collector is entitled to the percentage share determined for it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remuneration claims below the technical minimum amount will not be paid out. The currently applicable
            technical minimum amount is indicated <a href="/pricing">here</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Even after the end of registration as a Data Collector, the Data Collector shall be entitled to remuneration
          in accordance with the above provisions for the Company Data that continues to be available on the
          Platform-Dataland.
        </p>
        <p>
          All calculation bases on which the calculation of the Data Collector's remuneration claim is based in
          accordance with the above shall be made available to the Data Collector so that the Data Collector can
          understand and verify the calculation of its remuneration claim.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dataland shall pay the remuneration to the Data Collector within three months after the end of a calendar year
          for the Data Collector's services subject to remuneration during that calendar year.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>LTerm of registration as a Data Collector</h3>
        <p>Registration as a Data Collector is for an indefinite term.</p>
        <p>The registration can be cancelled by either party with one month's notice to the end of a calendar month.</p>
        <p>The right to terminate the contract for good cause remains unaffected in all cases.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>The following additional conditions apply to Data Owners:</h2>
      <p>
        Data Owners may also register as such on Dataland. As Data Owners, they have the right to use the Dataland
        Platform in the same way as a Data Collector or a Data User.
      </p>
      <p>
        Insofar as the Data Owner acts in accordance with a Data User, the provisions of § 3 shall apply, including the
        remuneration rules therein.
      </p>
      <p>
        Insofar as the Data Owner acts as a Data Collector, the provisions of § 4 shall apply, including the
        remuneration rules therein.
      </p>
      <div>
        <h3>Remuneration and payments</h3>
        <p>
          Registration as a Data Owner and the associated use of the Dataland platform as a Data Owner are free of
          charge, regardless of whether it is for private or commercial use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Irrespective of the remuneration to which a Data Owner is entitled due to an activity as a Data Collector
          pursuant to § 5.3 in conjunction with § 4, he/she may receive (additional) remuneration in accordance with the
          following principles:
        </p>
        <p>
          The starting point for the possible additional remuneration of the Data Owner is the data points that relate
          to the respective Data Owner during a calendar year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on this principle, a possible additional remuneration of the Data Owner after the end of the calendar
          year is derived as follows for this calendar year:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            After the end of each calendar year, Dataland may determine a share of the (net) income generated in
            accordance with § 3.2 (not taking into account the remuneration paid by means of Dataland Tokens), which
            shall be available as a total amount for the separate remuneration of the Data Owners.
          </li>
          <li>
            Furthermore, Dataland determines the distribution amount available for the respective day based on the
            revenue actually generated for each calendar day of this past calendar year ("Claim Days").
          </li>
          <li>
            ● Finally, Dataland determines how many data points according to § 4.1.2 existed in total on each individual
            day and how many data points are to be allocated to each individual data owner. In the case of data points
            for which there are versions of differing timeliness, only the most recent version of the data point is
            taken into account. A data owner is entitled to the percentage share determined for it
          </li>
          <li>
            ● Remuneration claims below the technical minimum amount will not be paid out. The currently applicable
            technical minimum amount is stated <a href="/pricing">here</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          All calculation bases on which the calculation of the Data Owner's remuneration claim is based in accordance
          with the above paragraph shall be made available to the Data Owner so that the Data Owner can understand and
          verify the calculation of its remuneration claim.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dataland shall pay the remuneration to the Data Owner within three months after the end of a calendar year for
          the Data Owner's services subject to remuneration during that calendar year.

        <h3>Term of registration as a data owner</h3>
        <p>Registration as a data owner is for an indefinite term.</p>
        <p>The registration can be cancelled by either party with one month's notice to the end of a calendar month.</p>
        <p>Cancellation for good cause remains unaffected in any case.</p>

      <h2>Dataland token</h2>
      <p>
        In addition to the unrestricted possibility of fulfilling all payment obligations in connection with the
        Dataland Platform by making payments on a euro basis, it is also possible to fulfil payment obligations using
        these Dataland Tokens by means of the Dataland Tokens created and issued by Dataland. The Dataland Tokens are
        issued and used in accordance with the following principles:
      </p>
      <p>Dataland will create Dataland tokens. Each Dataland token has a nominal value of one euro.</p>
      <p>
        The prerequisite for the possession and use of Dataland Tokens by Dataland Participants is the conclusion of a
        Token Custody Agreement <a href="/token">Link</a> between the Dataland Participant and the Custodian.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dataland undertakes to accept Dataland Tokens as a means of payment in accordance with the provisions of these
        GTC-Dataland in such a way that one Dataland Token is equivalent to one euro.
      </p>
      <p>Dataland is not obliged to take back Dataland Tokens or to refund payments made for Dataland Tokens.</p>
      <p>
        Dataland is free and in no way restricted with regard to the use and transfer of Dataland Tokens. In particular,
        Dataland Participants are not entitled to any rights to demand specific behaviour from Dataland in relation to
        the Dataland Tokens, unless Dataland has committed itself to specific behaviour in relation to the Dataland
        Tokens by virtue of express contractual provisions.
      </p>
      <div>
        <h3>Dataland intends to offer and transfer the Dataland Tokens to Dataland Participants as follows:</h3>
        <p>
          Dataland intends to offer Data Owners the purchase of Dataland Tokens. In doing so, Dataland does not act at
          its own discretion with regard to the number of Dataland Tokens offered in each case, nor with regard to their
          pricing, and in particular without any obligation to treat Data Owners equally.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dataland intends to offer Data Collectors the fulfilment of their remuneration claims with Dataland Tokens. In
          doing so, Dataland acts at its own discretion both with regard to the number of Dataland Tokens offered in
          each case and with regard to their pricing, and in particular without any obligation to treat Data Collectors
          equally. Data Collectors are free to decide whether they wish to accept a corresponding offer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dataland may also offer the purchase of Dataland Tokens to the other Dataland Participants. Here too, Dataland
          shall act at its own discretion both with regard to the number of Dataland Tokens offered in each case and
          with regard to their pricing and, in particular, without any obligation to treat Dataland Participants equally
          in this respect.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        As soon as Dataland Tokens are available for use and purchase on Dataland, Dataland Participants have the right
        to fulfil 50% of their respective payment obligations to Dataland with Dataland Tokens.
