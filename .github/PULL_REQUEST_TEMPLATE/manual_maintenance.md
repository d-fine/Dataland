## Dataland Monitoring
- [ ] Go to the monitoring repository and execute the tasks described in the manual maintenance template there

## Server updates
Execute `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade` on
- [ ] dev1.dataland.com
- [ ] dev2.dataland.com
- [ ] test.dataland.com
- [ ] tunnel.dataland.com
- [ ] letsencrypt.dataland.com

## Check e-mails sent by keycloak
- [ ] Check that the verification e-mail is sent and displayed correctly
- [ ] Check that the reset password e-mail is sent and displayed correctly
- [ ] Check that the password can be reset
- [ ] Check that account linking via e-mail verification works correctly
- [ ] Check that account linking via username & password verification works correctly

## Check e-mails sent by backend
- [ ] Send an invitation request from one of the dev servers and check if the e-mail response contains the right attachments and is displayed correctly.

## Check RabbitMQ dead letter queue and disk space
- [ ] RabbitMQ does need at least 768MB of free disk space to operate. `ssh` into all servers and check the available disk space with `df` command. If the open disk space is close to the minimum requirement, clear up disk space with `docker image prune`.
- [ ] On all environments, no new messages should have been added to the dead letter queue since the last manual maintenance. If new messages have appeared this does need to be investigated. The dead letter queue can be accessed and messages on it read in the RabbitMQ GUI. Access it by port-forwarding port `6789` from the server and then accessing the GUI at `localhost:6789/rabbitmq`. After login, the dead letter queue can be found at Queues &rarr; deadLetterQueue &rarr; Get message.

## Conclusion
- [ ] After updating all components check if everything still works
- [ ] The new version is deployed to a dev server using this branch and real data
  - [ ] It's verified that this version actually is the one deployed (check gitinfo for branch name and commit id!)
  - [ ] It's verified that real data has been used
  - [ ] It's verified that everything seems to be working fine by manually using the website
- [ ] This template has been updated to reflect the latest state of tasks required and known issues with upgrades
- [ ] The Merge Request commit message needs to contain 'manual maintenance' to satisfy the CI maintenance check in future commits

# Review (to be completed by the reviewer)
- [x] The Github Actions (including Sonarqube Gateway and Lint Checks) are green. This is enforced by Github.
- [ ] A peer-review has been executed
  - [ ] The code has been manually inspected by someone who did not implement the feature
- [ ] The PR actually implements what is described above
- [ ] Documentation is updated as required
- [ ] The automated deployment is updated if required
- [ ] The new version is deployed to a dev server using this branch
  - [ ] It's verified that this version actually is the one deployed (check gitinfo for branch name and commit id!)
  - [ ] It's verified that everything seems to be working fine by manually using the website
  - [ ] All implemented Social Logins have been tested manually in the UI
  - [ ] Go to the swagger-UI, authorize, run a "GET" request to the companies endpoint and assure that your authorization has worked by assuring that you get a 200 response

- [ ] If any work on the UI is to be merged, those changes were also documented in the Figma
- [ ] The local Dev stack still works: execute `startDevelopmentStack.sh` and execute `npm run testpipeline -- --env EXECUTION_ENVIRONMENT=""` in dataland-frontend
- [ ] After(!) the cypress tests have passed locally, execute the backend-e2e-tests `./gradlew dataland-e2etests:test`
- [ ] Locally: Go to the swagger-UI, authorize, run a "GET" request to the companies endpoint and assure that your authorization has worked by assuring that you get a 200 response
