Please check all boxes before the Pull Request is merged. In case you skip a box, describe in the PRs description (that means: here) why the check is skipped.
- [x] The Github Actions (including Sonarqube Gateway and Lint Checks) are green. This is enforced by Github. 
- [ ] A peer-review has been executed
  - [ ] The code has been manually inspected by someone who did not implement the feature
- [ ] The PR actually implements what is described in the JIRA-Issue
- [ ] At least one E2E Test exists testing the new feature
- [ ] Documentation is updated as required
- [ ] The automated deployment is updated if required
- [ ] The new version is deployed to the dev server using this branch
  - [ ] It's verified that this version actually is the one deployed (check actuator/info for branch name and commit id!)
  - [ ] The new feature is manually used/tested/observed on dev server
  - [ ] All implemented Social Logins have been tested manually in the UI
- [ ] If any work on the UI is to be merged, those changes were also documented in the Figma 
- [ ] The local Dev stack still works: execute `startDevelopmentStack.sh`, execute npm run cypress and run Cypress Tests locally
