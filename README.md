# Developer Remarks

## add scripts to git with the executable flag
Especially under Windows, it's unclear which file permissions a script will get. 
To explicitly mark a script executable, do:
`git update-index --chmod=+x script.sh`

## Run Cypress Tests locally
* start the docker-compose stack with the "development" profile. Set the env-variables (see above). 
* start the backend - e.g. in IntelliJ or using gradle. Use the spring profile "development"
* start the frontend - using `npm run serve`. to be safe do an `npm install` and a `./gradlew generateAPIClientFrontend` beforehand.
* start the E2E cypress tests using `npm run teste2e`

## Dependency Management
we try to keep our dependencies up to date. Therefore, every sprint we update dependency versions in a separate PR.
To do so:
* Execute `gradlew dependencyUpdates` to get a report on Dependencies with updates
* update `settings.gradle.kts` (for libraries), `build.gradle.kts` (for plugins) and `gradle.properties` (for jacoco)
* Note: fasterXML is managed by spring and ktlint by jlleitschuh, thus NO manual version update should be conducted
* update the gradle wrapper: execute `gradle wrapper --gradle-version X.Y.Z`
* Update Fronted packages: run the `updatepackages` script, e.g. by  `npm run updatepackages` to update versions in package.json  
  Run the `updatepackagelock`, e.g. by  `npm run updatepackagelock` script to update `package-lock.json` and check for security issues 
  (Known issues appeared in the past with updating Jest, openApiGenerator and Eslint).
* Update Docker images: run CypressImage and TemurinImage jobs in GitHub actions
* Update node version in `dataland-frontend/build.gradle.kts`
* Do the above also for the connected Repos (SkyminderClient, DatalandEDC). Publish new versions of artifacts if required. Use the new artifacts wherever relevant
* After updating all components check if everything is still working
